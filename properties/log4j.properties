# An example log4j configuration file that outputs both to System.out
# and a file named 'test'.

# For the general syntax of property based configuration files see the
# documenation of org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.

# WARNING: Location information can be useful but is very costly in
# terms of computation.

# The root logger uses the appender called A1. 

# The root logger uses the appenders called A1 and A2. Since no level
# is specified, note the empty string between the comma (",") and the
# equals sign ("="), the level of the root logger remains
# untouched. Log4j always initializes the level for the root logger to
# DEBUG. The root logger is the only logger that has a default
# level. Bu default, all other loggers do not have an assigned level,
# such that they inherit their level instead.
